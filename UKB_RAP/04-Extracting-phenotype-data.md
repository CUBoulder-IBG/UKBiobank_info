This article assumes you already have a RAP project and that your project has UKB data dispensed to it. If you have not yet completed these steps, please refer to the article [Getting started with a RAP project](02-Getting-started-with-a-RAP-project.md) first.

There three main ways to access phenotype data on RAP:
1. Exporting relevant data fields to a .csv/.tsv file
2. Creating a "View" with the desired participants and data fields, then using that view as input to an app on DNANexus.
3. Via Apache Spark, either directly or through relevant tools in a language such as Python (this option is mostly for advanced users)
