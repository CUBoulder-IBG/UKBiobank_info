This directory contains documentation on using the UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform (UKB RAP).

Files with numbers at the beginning are things that are important for getting started using UKB RAP and should be read in order.

Files without numbers at the beginning cover tasks that may be of interest to some (or many) users, but that do not need to be read in a particular order.

If you are adding documentation in this directory, you can give the file an ending of ".md" to make it a markdown file that lets you use headers/bold/italics/links. Markdown is easy to learn - if you click any file in this directorr\y and choose "Code" (next to "Preview") you will be able to see the markdown for the formatting in that file.
