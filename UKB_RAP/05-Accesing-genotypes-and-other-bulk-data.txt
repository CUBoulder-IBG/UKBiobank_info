This article assumes you already have a RAP project and that your project has UKB data dispensed to it. If you have not yet completed these steps, please refer to the article "02-Getting-started-with-a-RAP-project.txt" first.

Options for accessing bulk data (such as genotypes and imaging data) include:
1. Specifying the bulk data directly as input to a DNANexus app
2. Making the bulk data accessible in an environment where you are working or running a job
(FIXME: Add better descriptions after actually trying these things)
