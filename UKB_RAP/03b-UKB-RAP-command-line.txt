##### Installing the command-line tools on Mac OS X #####

In order to install the DNANexus command-line tools, you must have Python3 installed (this might already be
installed by default).

Once you have Python3 installed, open a Terminal window and run the command "pip3 install dxpy"

The installer is likely to show you several warnings like "WARNING: The scripts dx, dx-app-wizard, dx-build-app
and dx-build-applet are installed in '/Users/yourusername/Library/Python/3.9/bin' which is not on PATH." These
warnings mean that in order to run these commands, you would need to type the full path, eg. to run dx you would
type "/Users/yourusername/Library/Python/3.9/bin/dx". This is annoying - to fix it, you need to add the directory
to your PATH setting.

To add this directory to your path:
1. Check which shell you are using by running "env | grep SHELL"
2. If the result of step 1 says "/bin/zsh":
  a. Edit (or create) the file ~/.zshrc, and add the following line to the bottom of the file:
        export PATH="$PATH:/Users/yourusername/Library/Python/3.9/bin/"
        (replace "yourusername" with your Mac OS username)
  b. Run the command "source ~/.zshrc" to activate the change you made
3. If the result of step 1 says "/bin/bash", follow the instructions in step 2, but instead of
   using the file ~/.zshrc use either ~/.bash_profile (if you use MacOS's default Terminal.app),
   or ~/.bashrc (if you use almost any terminal other than Terminal.app).
