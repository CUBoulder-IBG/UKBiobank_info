UKB RAP is based on the DNANexus platform. To access the UKB RAP web interface, log in at https://ukbiobank.dnanexus.com/

When you log in, you will see a list of all of your RAP projects on the first page. Click the name of the project you would like to work under to open the details page for that project. If you do not see any projects listed, please refer to the article [Getting started with a RAP project](02-Getting-started-with-a-RAP-project.md).

### Mananging project data via the web interface

The "Manage" tab lets you manage project data.

To create files or directories, or to upload data from your computer, use the "Add" button in the top right corner of the "Manage" pane.

If you check the box next to a file's name in the main pane, two additional buttons labeled "Copy" and "Delete" will appear in the top right corner.

### Accessing RStudio or JupyterLab via the web interface

At the very top of the page (higher than the project-related tabs) you will see four menus - "Projects", "Tools", "Org Admin" and "Help". To access RStudio or JupyterLab, use the "Tools" menu and select the tool you want to use. You will need to specify a project to run your RStudio or JupyterLab session under. These tools run as jobs and will be billed to the billing account associated with your project.

### Running apps via the web interface

To run apps, go to the "Manage" tab and look in the top right corner for a button labeled "Start Analysis". This button will let you launch one of the apps installed on DNANexus such as Table Exporter, Swiss Army Knife, and Cloud Workstation. These apps run as jobs and will be billed to the billing account associated with your project.

The "Monitor" tab shows your current, pending, and completed jobs on RAP. This tab also gives you the ability to check job logs or terminate pending/running jobs.

### Managing your project using the web interface

The "Settings" tab allows you to manage project access and billing. This is also the tab you would use if you needed to dispense (make available) additional UKB data for your project that was not included during project creation.

Most of the features on the "Settings" tab require admin-level access to the project. You have admin-level access if you created the project, or if someone else has given you admin-level access.

To add a member to your project:
1. Go to the "Settings" tab
2. Click the "Share Project" button, which is a small round button with a picture of two people on it.
   * If you have trouble finding it, it is next to the words "Access: Admin", below the bell icon for notifications, and below the colorful circle with a letter in it that lets you access your profile.
3. Enter the DNANexus username or email address of the person you want to add, and then choose the level of project access that you want to give them.
