UKB RAP is based on the DNANexus platform. To access the UKB RAP web interface, log in at https://ukbiobank.dnanexus.com/

When you log in, you will see a list of all of your RAP projects on the first page. Click the name of the project you would like to work under to open the details page for that project. If you do not see any projects listed, please refer to the article [Getting started with a RAP project](02-Getting-started-with-a-RAP-project.md).

Once you have entered a RAP project, there will be four tabs near the top of the page:
1. "Settings" where you can manage project access and billing. This is also the tab you would use if you needed to dispense (make available) additional UKB data to your project that was not included during project creation.
2. "Manage" where you can manage project data or start analyses using DNANexus apps.
   * Using the "Add" button in the top right corner, you can create folders or upload files from your computer.
   * If you check the box next to a file displayed in the main pane, two additional buttons named "Copy" and "Delete" will appear near the top right corner.
   * In the top right corner, there is a button called "Start Analysis" that will let you launch one of the DNANexus apps such as Table Exporter (see the article "Accessing phenotype data on RAP" for more information about how to use Table Exporter)
3. "Monitor" which shows your current, pending, and completed jobs on RAP and gives you the ability to check job logs or terminate pending/running jobs.
4. "Visualize" which gives you access to apps available on DNANexus for data visualization, such as Genome Browser

At the very top of the page (higher than the project-related tabs) you will see four menus - "Projects", "Tools", "Org Admin" and "Help". To access RStudio or JupyterLab, use the "Tools" menu and select the tool you want to use. You will need to specify a project to run your RStudio or JupyterLab session under.
