Things that still need articles created:
* Costs and billing
* RStudio on RAP
* Bulk jobs on RAP
* Apps on RAP
* Selecting an environment and options for your job
* Using git to sync code to/from RAP

Articles that need things added:
* [Instructions for signing up for UKB RAP](01-Instructions-for-signing-up-for-UKB-RAP.md): Ask Pamela what the "UK Biobank accession number" thing means
* [DNANexus web interface](03a-DNANexus-web-interface.md): Sections currently say what tabs can be used for, but need details (eg. *how* to access job logs via the Monitor tab)
* [DNANexus command line](03b-DNANexus-command-line.md): Using command line tools to manage projects, using command line tools to start apps
* [Installing the command line tools](Installing-the-command-line-tools.md): Add instructions for Linux and Windows

Articles that barely exist and still need to be written:
* [Extracting phenotype data](04-Extracting-phenotype-data.md)
* [Accessing data and saving results](05-Accessing-data-and-saving-results.md)
* [Interactive Linux sessions](Interactive-Linux-sessions.md)

Other things:
* Both the web and command line instructions for adding users to your project need a warning added that anything users run will be billed to your starting credits, not theirs.
* Go hunting for broken links left over after file/document section renaming
