This file instructs a PI on how to set up single-payer billing for projects on UKB RAP. 

# Instructions: 
0. Create an AMS and RAP accounts (separate processes). Please see _UKB_RAP/01-Instructions-for-signing-up-for-UKB-RAP.md_ for instructions on starting on UKB RAP.  
1. Click on your profile/avatar on the top right 
2. Click billing from the dropdown 
3. Click the account you'd like to set up billing for and select "Start setup"
4. Review and agree to terms of service 
5. Fill in personal details
6. Enter the billing address and payment method 
  - Note: credit cards are required for auto-pay and can only be set up via the portal 
  - enter the email address you'd like to receive receipts to 
  - make sure you include a spending limit based on your lab's needs and comfort level with UKB RAP
7. If your students have already created a project on RAP, have them add you as an administrator to that project. They can do so with the email address you used to open your own RAP account. 
8. Navigate back to your list of projects. You should now be able to assign projects associated with your lab to be billed to your billing account.
